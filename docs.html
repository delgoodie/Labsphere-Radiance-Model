                The radiance model is a web tool that lets you model, analyze, and compare spectral radiance plots. This is done through projects, which are groups of tabs, and each tab contains a single spectral radiance model. This program is equivalent to the former
                Helios Configurator in Excel. This page will explain how to use each part of the website. Use the Outline on the left to navigate to a specific topic and click on the feedback button to email any questions, concerns, or requests to William
                Del Giudice.

                In the top right corner of the website, there are four icons, the first of which brought you to this doc. The lightbulb prompts you to upload custom lamp (flux) data. The moon toggles dark mode. Lastly, the trash can allows for all cookies to be cleared,
                including all projects and custom lamp data.
                <br><br><span class='notice'>NOTICE:</span>If you clear cookies on the web radiance tool, you can still upload saved project.json files, which will be put back in cookies once uploaded. The cookies just offer a convenient way to work with
                the model without downloading and the re-uploading all projects every time you use the model.

                A project is a group of tabs.To get started modeling you first must create a project in the Project Folder. You can access the project folder by clicking on the blue bar at the top of the webpage with the folder icon. This bar will also display the current
                project name. Once in the project folder, you can Create a project, or Upload a project. Creating a project will add a project file and prompt you to enter a new project name, which will default to New Project. You can also click on an
                existing project to open it or delete a project. By clicking the download icon, you can save a project as a .json file. Then you can drag and drop the file into the Project Folder, Upload the project, or send it to another computer.
                <br><br><span class='notice'>NOTICE:</span>If you send a project.json file with custom lamps to another computer, you must upload the custom lamp files under the same name, (case sensitive) to the receiving computer.

            <t>Tabs</t>
            <p>
                A tab is a single radiance model, either computed by the radiance predictor, or plotted from fixed data. Currently there is only one type of tab, the model tab, but the structure of the website could allow for multiple tab types. A tab can be downloaded
                as a .csv file, which can be opened with Excel. A tab can also be in multiple states, indicated by the title above the graph. If the tab is a Calculated Model, Helios Model, or Helios Model - Modified, the graph represents a calculated
                prediction of the spectral radiance, and the specs and lamps can be modified. If the tab is a Measured Model or Excel Model, the graph is in a fixed state and the specs and lamps have no effect on it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <a id='specs'></a>
        <div class='section'>
            <t>Specs</t>
            <p>
                The top left box in every tab is the specs box. It contains five inputs and three outputs. If the tab is a Calculated, Helios, or Helios - Modified Model <a class='reference' href='#tabs'>(see Tabs)</a>, these specs will be reflected in
                the spectral radiance calculations. The Name input will change the tab name, as well as the graph legend.
            </p>
        </div>
        <a id='requirements'></a>
        <div class='section'>
            <t>Requirements</t>
            <p>
                The upper right box is for requirements, containing three separate panes: In-Band Radiance, Irradiance, and Spectral Radiance.
                <br>The In-Band Radiance pane lets you enter In-Band radiance requirements that will be displayed as bins on the graph. Bins whose calculated In-Band radiance is greater than the required In-Band radiance will appear green, while a calculated
                radiance less than the required value will be red.
                <br>The second pane is for Irradiance requirements. This is a calculator that lets you measure the In-Band irradiance at a distance in meters from the exit port. The predicted value will turn green if it is greater than the required value,
                and red if it is less.
                <br>The third pane is Spectral Radiance. This table lets you indicate upper and lower radiance values that you would like the model to fit between. If any modeled radiance value is less than the lower tolerance, the lower tolerance plot
                will turn red, as with the upper tolerance plot. There is also an upload option which allows you to enter an excel sheet with spectral tolerances.
                <br><br><span class='notice'>Excel File Format: </span>
                <br>First column: Wavelength - the first row will be discarded, as it is assumed to be the ‘Wavelength’ header
                <br>Second Column: Lower Radiance - the first row will be used as the name of the lower tolerance
                <br>Third Column: Upper Radiance - the first row will be used as the name of the upper tolerance Make sure to have an equal number of wavelength and radiance rows, empty radiance rows in-between the radiance column will throw an error.
                <br><br><span class='notice'>NOTICE:</span>All requirements should be entered in units according to the graph and changing the graph units will automatically convert all requirements inputs. When uploading a spectral radiance excel sheet,
                make sure to set the proper units in the upload prompt, which can be different from the current graph units.

            </p>
        </div>
        <a id='graph'></a>
        <div class='section'>
            <t>Graph</t>
            <p>
                The graph is the top center box of every Model Tab. The graph will display the current model plot, any In-Band, and Spectral Requirements, as well as plots from other tabs. The graph also contains several tools below that affect the model. The units box
                will determine the units of the current tab. The Sphere Icon opens the Custom Loader, The Calculator Icon produces a Reverse Radiance Model, the Globe Icon adds the current tab to the global models, and the Download Icon prompts a tab
                download. As previously mentioned, when a tab is toggled as global, all other tabs in that project will display its radiance plot, as well as any other global tabs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <a id='custom-loader'></a>
        <div class='section'>
            <t>Custom Loader</t>
            <p>
                The custom loader is a feature of the Graph box, which allows you to introduce different model types to the tab. The first input box allows you to choose the type of model you want to load. The Helios Type will overlay Helios Model presets, changing the
                tabs specs and lamps to reflect the selected Helios Model, while still predicting the Spectral Radiance. The Measured Model will allow you to similarly select a Helios Model, however, on selecting a Measured Model, the tab will display
                a measured, fixed radiance plot, no longer affected by specs or lamps. The measured radiance was taken from the HeDab database. The third option, Excel Model, allows you to upload a custom Excel file containing a model plot.
                <br><br><span class='notice'>Excel File Format:</span>
                <br>First Column: Wavelength - the first row will be discarded, as it is assumed to be the ‘Wavelength’ header
                <br>Second Column: Radiance - the first row will be used as the name of the tab

                <br><br><span class='notice'>Notice:</span>Make sure to have an equal number of wavelength and radiance rows, empty radiance rows in-between the radiance column will throw an error.

        <a id='reverse-model'></a>
        <div class='section'>
            <t>Reverse Model</t>
            <p>
                The reverse radiance model calculator is a feature of the Graph box, which allows you to create a model based on the Requirements. Once you have entered or uploaded data to the Spectral Radiance table of the Requirements box, you can press the Calculator
                Icon under the graph to perform the reverse radiance calculation, as soon as it is done, the lamps and specs will be applied to the tab.
                <br><br><span class='notice'>NOTICE:</span>If the reverse calculation doesn’t succeed, freezes the website, or causes another error, please use the feedback button to report the problem. Please also attach the project.json file and indicate
                the tab you were trying to perform a reverse calculation on.
            </p>
        </div>
        <a id='lamp-table'></a>
        <div class='section'>
            <t>Lamp Table</t>
            <p>
                The lamp table is the lower middle box, used for changing the lamps of the model. The lamp table will only have an effect on the model in Calculated, Helios, or Helios - Modified Models <a class='reference' href='#tabs'>(see Tabs)</a>.
                The Lamp Table has two states, dependant on the Port Count value in the Specs box. If the Port Count is less than or equal to five, each row will take up one port of the modeled sphere. If the Port Count is greater than five, each row
                will indicate a type of lamp, the quantity of which can be greater than one. The QTY header will also display the current number of ports used over the total ports. Next to the QTY column will appear the QTY ON column, which cannot exceed
                the QTY value. The QTY is used to determine the wall fraction, whereas the QTY ON is used to determine the total flux. Converting from >5 ports to
                <=5 ports will reset all lamp quantities to 1. Clicking on the name of the lamp will open the Lamp Selector Pane. This will allow you to search and replace the selected lamp. The type can be filtered by All, QTH Internal, QTH External, Xenon, and Plasma.
                    The derated filter, which only applies when the type filter is QTH Internal or QTH External, sorts by regular or derated lamps. Lastly, the power filter only shows lamps with the selected power, in watts. If no lamps match the entered
                    power, the power input will turn red. </p>

        <div class='section'>
            <t>Output</t>
            <p>
                The lower right box is the Output pane. This pane displays five calculated output specs CCT, Lumens, Candelas, Foot Lamberts, and Lux. These specs will not be valid if the model type is Excel or Measured <a class='reference' href='#tabs'>(see Tabs)</a>.
            </p>

            <t>Visual</t>
            <p>
                The Visual box is located in the lower right corner of every Model Tab, and provides a visual representation of and Calculated, Helios, or Helios - Modified Models. The sphere image is derived from the Sphere Diameter, currently only supporting 8”, 12”,
                and 20” spheres. The port size is determined by the Port Diameter entered from the Specs box. The port color is derived from the CCT value, from the Output box. If you have a sphere image in other sphere diameters, please email it through
                the Feedback button.
